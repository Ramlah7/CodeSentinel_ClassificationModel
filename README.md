# Classification Model using Scikit-learn

This project was developed as **Task 2** of my virtual internship at **Code Sentinel (Artificial Intelligence Program)**.

## 📌 Task Overview

**Objective:** Build and evaluate a classification model using Scikit-learn on a sample dataset (Iris or Titanic).  
This includes applying preprocessing techniques, trying multiple algorithms, and comparing model performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
I used the **Iris dataset**, which contains information about different species of Iris flowers and their measurements.

## 🔄 Preprocessing Techniques
- Handled missing values (if any)
- Label encoding for categorical data
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`

## 🧠 Models Trained
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## ✅ Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

## 📈 Results
All models were evaluated and compared based on accuracy and other metrics.  
Final comparison includes confusion matrices and classification reports for deeper insight.
